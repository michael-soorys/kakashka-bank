# kakashka-bank

### What is this?

This is a full stack app that uses Flask, React and MongoDB. The purpose of this app is to be a learning tool for me and my little sister. I am learning primarily 
python by building the app. The app is a bank-like application meant to serve and provide financial education to a single user. 

It supports:
- Recurrning deposits (static weekly allowance)
- Normal deposits
- Withdrawals
- Weekly interest payments at 1.33% to encourage and educate savings and compound interest benefits
- Crediting at 15%
- Deez Nuts

### How does it work?

The app itself is unaware about actual money and actual transactions. It's mostly a book-keeping app, with all transactions being settled manually and in person
based on app activity. So after requesting a withdrawal, sis can come to me and ask for money from her account, same for deposits and credit.

Hopefully sis won't outsmart me and bankrupt me by the time she's 18 :)
